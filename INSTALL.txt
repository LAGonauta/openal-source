Instructions for properly installing/building these files:

A) Download and install the following libraries:

   OpenAL:
     http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/OpenAL11CoreSDK.zip

   libogg:
     http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.2.0.zip

   libvorbis:
     http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/libvorbis-1.3.1.zip

B) Add the include directories from those libraries to your project

C) Link the client DLL to the libraries that you've downloaded.

D) Build your project

E) Copy the "sounds" directory from this project into your mod's GAMEDIR

F) To test OpenAL, start up your mod and run this in the console:
   openal_ogg_demo_play

You should be hearing some music now. As you might notice, audio plays in
the game's main menu. It is also able to be played at any other time once
the engine has started. This includes during the loading process between
maps.

G) You can run this console command to stop playback:
openal_ogg_demo_stop

NOTE: The song distributed by this project is made by the author of the

      distribution going on here.
