Instructions for properly installing/building these files:

A) Download and install the following libraries:

   OpenAL (Not needed if you have hardware AL support):
     http://openal-soft-1.12.854-bin.zip

   libogg:
     http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.2.0.zip

   libvorbis:
     http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/libvorbis-1.3.1.zip

B) Add the include directories from those libraries to your project

C) Link the client DLL to the libraries that you've downloaded. You should
   link OpenAL dynamically, in order to respect anyone with cards that
	 support hardware acceleration.

D) Build your project

E) Copy the "sounds" directory from this project into your mod's GAMEDIR

F) To test OpenAL, start up your mod and run this in the console:
   openal_ogg_demo_play

You should be hearing some music now. As you might notice, audio plays in
the game's main menu. It is also able to be played at any other time once
the engine has started. This includes during the loading process between
maps.

G) You can run this console command to stop playback:
openal_ogg_demo_stop

NOTE: The song distributed by this project is made by the author of the
      project, so there is no violations of Copyrights or other illegal
      distribution going on here.
